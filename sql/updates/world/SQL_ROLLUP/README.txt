Aight all those updates were causing serious timeline issues and making things impossible for ppl to update....

the world updates were rolled up to be ready to be moved to DB for an update pack....
the DIR for Applied renamed, everything that WAS in applied, and in the roll-up has been
moved to its proper location "sql\old\4.0.6a" please delete this Directory after the rollups
are moved to DB Repo... thanks DBT.

Note: To Everyone, 
those Whom are importing New Db from the Db Repo, 

IF YOUR READING THIS...

you will need to run the sql "All_World_Updates.sql" 

"BEFORE" running any of the other sql fixes in updates/world!!!
